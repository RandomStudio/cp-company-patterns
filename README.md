# Pattern Experiments

Created with `create-react-app` - more details [here](./README_CREATE_REACT_APP)

## Development quick start

```
yarn install
yarn run start
```

## TODO

- Pick a representative colour background/overlay from the original image/garment/fabric instead of manual colour (Andrew H did something like this recently?)
- Attempt to select "salient feature" position in order to scale and crop appropriately on image (ML?)
- Automatically set threshold to appropriate level
